      with an approximate delivery date. We will not be held responsible for
      delays beyond our control and/or cancellations of backordered merchandise
      ordered specifically for you. <h5>Length Of Cuts</h5> The length of your
      cuts is very important in the processing of your orders. On occasion, we
      must fill your order with more than one piece, or make an allowance for a
      defect in the fabric. Please be certain to include cuts on every order.
      <h5>Face Of Fabric</h5> Before cutting and fabricating with your order,
      please confirm with your workroom or upholsterer the proper face of the
      cloth. First Impression Furnishings llp will not be held responsible if
      the incorrect side of the fabric is used as the face in application.
      <h5>Pattern Repeats</h5> All pattern repeats listed in this Price List and
      on our samples are approximate. They can vary slightly from one dyelot to
      the next. We cut the fabric to the exact meterage amount specified on the
      order, and do not automatically make additional allowances to include
      pattern repeats. To avoid a possible shortage, we recommend that you order
      several additional inches to allow for pattern repeats. Dyelots{" "}
      <h5>Dyelots</h5>
      <p>
        do vary from one shipment to another. If you require an exact dyelot
        match, you must submit a sample with your order or request a Cutting for
        Approval (CFA) from current stock. We cannot accept returns or issue
        credit for dyelot variation unless a sample was submitted with your
        order. Sample charges will be inimated seperately.{" "}
      </p>
      <h5>Handloomed Fabrics</h5>
      <p>
        Pattern repeats in handloomed fabrics may vary. All measurements quoted
        for repeats are approximate. Side matching of repeats on ikats, stripes,
        checks, plaids and ribbed patterns will not be exact. Because of
        variations in dyelots, yarns and weaves, the fabric in stock may vary
        from samples. We recommend a CFA from current stock be requested.{" "}
      </p>
      <h5>Silks</h5>{" "}
      <p>
        We do not guarantee silks against fading or for precise color matching,
        colorfastness and durability. Cutting from current stock is recommended.
      </p>{" "}
      <h5>Reserves</h5>{" "}
      <p>
        We will reserve meterage for ten (10) working days for customers with an
        account number. Cuttings and Reserves or COD/Proforma Reserves will also
        be held for ten (10) working days. We are not obligated to inform
        customers that a reserve has expired.
      </p>{" "}
      <h5>Minimum Meterage</h5>{" "}
      <p>
        No orders will be accepted for less than one (1) meter per individual
        cut.
      </p>
      <h5>Pricing</h5>{" "}
      <p>All prices listed herein are subject to change without notice.</p>{" "}
      <h5>Shipping</h5> Please indicate on your order your desired method of
      shipment (i.e.,surface or air courier). If no instructions are given, we
      will ship by surface or air courier at our discretion depending on the
      size of the package. Drapery fabrics, due to yarn contents, construction,
      humidity, etc., will expand or contract under certain conditions. This is
      inherent to the fabric. First Impression Furnishings llp will not be
      responsible should this situation occur. Sufficient fabric allowances
      should be made for hems for later adjustments, should it become necessary.
